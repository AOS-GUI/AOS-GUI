Welcome to the USER MANUAL!

## UI

The menubar is located at the top of your screen, as shown below.

Contained within it is the main menu, which you can access by clicking on `AOS - (username)`. Inside of this menu are the actions `Run...`, `Settings`, and `Exit`.

### menubar actions

|Run...| Run a program. This can be a system or a custom app (custom apps are recognized in `(AOS)/files/apps/`|
|Settings| Accesses settings|
|Exit|Exits AOS|

### desktop

The desktop is what contains all of the buttons that link to applications. You can customize which buttons are on the desktop in the `settings` app.

## Apps

Documentation on all of the AOS-GUI system apps is below.

### AOShelp

### aterm

### editor
