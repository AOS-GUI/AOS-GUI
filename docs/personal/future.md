# plans for the future

- AOS-GUI will run smoothly on every major operating system, including Windows, Mac OS and Linux
    - No differences between host operating systems

    - Executables from Windows, Mac OS, and Linux will be runnable using `wine`, (maybe) `sosumi` and `box86`
- AOS-GUI will have its own file formats, including image, video, and audio formats
- AOS-GUI's terminal will have multiple shell modes. It will transition seamlessly between `aosh`, `sh` and maybe more
- There will be a text-based counterpart, like the old AOS versions, as well as a TUI version
- There will be an email client, IRC client, and other utilities included in camelInstall's package database
- There will be a custom programming language available that can be transpiled into Python and PyQt5
    - with full `nanolang` libraries for this purpose as well
- File manager will be overhauled
